After mastering this elemental talent, the Garou can then sniff out deeper secrets from passers-by.\nThis insight can also be used on people who beg for food, money, or assistance from the Garou; for instance, Hoods use this ability to distinguish someone who really needs help from a scam artist. Either way, this Gift is taught by a rat-spirit, usually while the student sits on a street corner asking for help over and over again; the rat gets a cut of any handouts during the time of training.\nIf you score five successes, some telltale clue also reveals more specific information. With spiritual insight, you can narrow down four or five choices of where his home may be, what company he works for, or the last item he just bought. Specific information may come as a vision of facts whispered by a helpful Gaffling.

If the Fianna didn’t murder St. Herve for this, they wanted to. But they also learned a lesson from it, and mischief-minded Fianna now use this carnivalesque Gift to create similar, though more pleasing, results. It convinces a leader of any sort that his status is incorrect and rather that he should serve those whom he rules. It can convince a town mayor to clean the shoes of a homeless person, or an alpha to bow to the will of his omega. The Gift is taught, unfortunately, by an ox-spirit.",

Garou and other supernaturals may resist this Gift by spending one point of Willpower, although if the Fianna continues her lecture and spends another point of Willpower, the victim must continue to resist. Effectively it becomes a bidding war between the victim and the Fianna; whoever has the most Willpower wins.",

As an aspect of Gaia, Demeter understood her daughter’s desire for Hades, but refused to let a powerful spirit remain in the deadlands for long. Eventually, Persephone acquiesced to return to the living realm, under the agreement that she could periodically return to Hades’ side, and could return to the Underworld eventually.\nDemeter agreed to this arrangement verbally, but eventually performed a secret ritual to block her daughter from entering the realms of the dead. Such travel is, after all, counter to the proper way of things. Embittered by her now-permanent separation from her lover, Persephone taught a number of favored Black Furies the secret roads into the land of the dead; these secrets have been passed down by Persephone’s servitor spirits and aged Garou to the present day. Technically, use of this Gift violates one of Gaia’s laws – “The living live, and the dead remain dead.” But since it is only used by the most ancient and respected Black Furies, and even then only in the most extreme circumstances, few punishments have come down onto those forced to use it.\nThe dead lurk near places, people, and things that were important to them in life, and they are creatures of almost pure emotion in death. They are still coherent, thinking beings, but are occasionally possesed of a terrible hate and fury toward the living, and may attack without provocation. When not so enraged, they do have most of their memories of life, and are likely to be willing to answer the Fury’s question if the two were friendly in life. This scene should be roleplayed out: no dice roll is an appropriate way to describe the character’s encounter with a deceased love one.\nNote: Storytellers with access to Wraith: the Oblivion are welcome to use that game’s version of the afterlife – in place of the Gauntlet rating, use the local Shroud, and so on.",

To learn the Gift, the Garou must undertake a great quest in Luna’s name, one that may take several game sessions to play out.

This creates a +2 difficulty to all the enemies’ rolls and removes two dice from their dice pools to boot. The spirits may steal an object from an enemy in the Umbra once per day.

Those werewolves who rise to the highest rank amongst the tribe sometimes learn the secret that Gaia imparted to the Great White Wolf after his sacrifice, one that deepens their connection to Her and allows them to be completely aware of their surroundings.\nEverything about her environment suddenly becomes part of the werewolf’s awareness. She can sense the lay of the land, the type and nature of the plants growing on it and what forms of animal life live there. She can sense what spirits are at work in the area’s Penumbra. The werewolf also gains some sense of the health of Gaia in that area. In an urban area, she might feel constricted or restrained, while in an area under attack by the Wyrm, she might feel itchy or in pain, depending on how successful the Wyrm minions are.\nAny Silver Fang of sufficient rank may learn this Gift, but the majority of those who learn it are Theurges. For some reason, members of House Wise Heart receive this Gift more frequently than to those of any other House. It is technically possible for a Garou of another tribe to learn this Gift, but it has not happened in living memory, and no song records such an event occurring. Those werewolves who do learn this Gift are often changed as a result. Many choose to walk barefoot on the earth whenever they can, and show a greater than usual aversion to cities. None of them can actually articulate what the secret is, saying that it is either something you understand, or you don’t.\nThe Gift lasts for one hour for each point of permanent Gnosis the werewolf has.

Great Uktena was around long before the Cherokee, but Garou have taken the form of his children on two or three occasions. Great Uktena teaches this Gift only to the most worthy of his Uktena followers; with it, the hero may transform into a creature even a Thunderwyrm would fear. After the crisis is resolved (assuming he lives), the new uktena slips into the nearest body of water and into the umbra, forever parting with his Garou brethren to join his father in Galunlati. Such a glorious end to an already legendary career is worthy of fireside retellings for generations.\n[Note: Frustratingly, stats for the uktena are not given for W:tA, but they do give Mind’s Eye Theater stats. Since these are very similar and can translate over, the MET stats for this Gift are included below:]\nThe statistics for a transformed uktena are as follows, except where noted, these statistics replace the Garou’s own, not add to them:\nPhysical Traits: 28, Social Traits: 3, Mental Traits: 14, Rage: 8, Gnosis: 8, Willpower: 6\nAbilities: As per the character, with the exception that they receive the following Abilities (unless their own levels are higher, in which case they retain their own level): Athletics x3, Brawl x3, Dodge x2, Intimidation x3, Subterfuge x2, Stealth x3. In addition they automatically receive an additional level of Enigmas and two levels of Occult, even if this takes them over five levels in total.\nHealth Levels: Healthy x2, Bruised x4, Wounded x5, Incapacitated, Mortally Wounded\nAttacks: Antler rush for one level of lethal damage, bite for two levels\nPowers: Armor, Breathe Water, Burrow (as the Metis Gift), Blast (as the charm)",

The initial stage of the transformation takes three full turns, during which the werewolf’s body grows and changes to a 20 foot horned serpent. The new uktena still retains the personality of the Garou at this point. After a period of time (usually no more than a scene), the final stage of the transformation begins as the mind of the Garou recedes and the uktena mindset takes over. The spirit creature heads unerringly towards the nearest source of water wide enough to encompass its diameter (not necessarily its whole bulk). As it slides into the water and crosses the Gauntlet, the transformation is complete; the hero’s former pack had best treat this uktena like any other of its kind.",
